      This page will help you make the decision. First, we must look at some of the tracks offered. Some of the available tracks at Epicodus are
      <div class="track-list">
        <ul>

          <li>CSS/Design</li>

      Each track has it's own benefits to offer and each track focus' on a different language. For now we will look at three languages. Although there are many more, these are what we will be looking at.

      <p>First let's consider the kind of programming you prefer. <strong>Front-end</strong>, which is more focused on what shows up on the webpage itself and the information that is in the browser itself. Though it is not neccesarily what makes a webpage "pretty," it is an essential component. Then we have <strong>Back-end</strong> which is more focused on the information within the server. It's what keeps things moving in the right direction data-wise and makes sure the interaction with the webpage is correct. lastly, we have what is called <strong>Full Stack</strong>, which can be considered a mix of both front-end and back-end.</p>
